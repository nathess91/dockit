**DockIt** is a CRM created for the reconstruction and remodeling industry. Its primary function is to organize an estimator's assignments and any associated required tasks as they move through the full reconstruction cycle.

###Focus on Sales

After realizing that their company's current technological applications nurtured all employees except the primary salespeople for the company, my client sought the creation of a CRM that would address these downfalls. **DockIt's** ultimate goal is to provide estimators with all tools necessary to enhance customer service levels, adhere to program requirements, and improve sales. **DockIt** also has built-in features that encourage sales management and performance review.


## The Dock

The main dock features **4** essential organizing tools that can be used to ensure job responsibilities are taken care of in a timely manner.

###To-Do List

Task items can be added in freely, marked as high priority or not, and created with specific due dates. High priority items are seen as such with a distinct red exclamation mark to the left, and these items are forced to the top of the list. An item must be marked as complete before it can be deleted.

###Assignments

The user is linked to all of their organized assignments in this area. 
Linked folder options include: 

* Current Assignments
* Awaiting Customer Response
* Jobs in Progress
* Not Sold
* Jobs Completed
* Jobs Closed 

All assignment data is created via user input, and new assignments are added by clicking New Assignment in the top left corner and selecting either Quick Add (pending most details) or Full Form (with full details). Regardless of the entry type, all assignments can be edited at any time to reflect the most up-to-date information.

###Resources

These are the client's five most frequently used links. The links route easily to corresponding log-in pages. Some automatic to-do list items require actions on these external sites.

###Bulletin Board

The bulletin board was created considering the client's difficulty having important company-wide messages read by employees. This is a particularly valuable feature for managers who want to ensure that everyone is on the same page.

Estimators can organize current assignments with all relevant details regarding the claim, pre-reconstructon work, different contacts involved, site information, customer contact notes, etc. The assignment will move through different stages in the sales or job process depending on what events occur within the assignment.
